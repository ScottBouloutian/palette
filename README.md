App for Colorizing User Interfaces ðŸŽ¨

Palette is a hybrid mobile application which makes it easy for selecting colors
for your user interfaces as a web developer. All you have to do is touch the color
you want, and then touch the domain in which you want it (Hex, RGB, etc.) After that
the color will be instantly copied to your clipboard. If you are on OSX, the color
can also then be automagically pasted into your favorite text editor!
